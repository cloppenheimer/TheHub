                    <h1>Project Description</h1>
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p> By 2020, it is estimated that there will be more than 30
                        billion devices on the internet. As such, it has become
                        increasingly important to educate students about the
                        internet of things, or concisely knowns as “IoT.”  In
                        order to do so, there are two main requirements:
                        wireless network and IoT devices. Many public schools
                        lack the funding to provide top-of-the-line technology
                        for students to use. Today, the technology used in many
                        classrooms are still predominantly Bluetooth (BLE)
                        communication devices.
                        </br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <div align="center">
                        <img src = "/Users/winnie/Desktop/Senior Design/Senior-Design/Website/Pi3.jpg" hspace="30" class="zoom"/>
                        <img src = "/Users/winnie/Desktop/Senior Design/Senior-Design/Website/Wedo.jpg" hspace="30" class="zoom"/>
                        <img src = "/Users/winnie/Desktop/Senior Design/Senior-Design/Website/Sphero.jpg" hspace="30" class="zoom"/>
                    </div>
                    <p> Our solution is to create an interface that will allow
                        Bluetooth devices to mimic the behavior of IoT devices,
                        communication with multiple devices through a cloud, as
                        opposed to the one-to-one communication that BLE devices
                        are capable of. We will be implementing the interface on
                        a Raspberry Pi 3. Only the Pi needs to be registered to
                        the school network, regardless of how many BLE devices
                        it’s acting as a relay for. The Pi will allow teachers
                        to register multiple BLE devices with it, and these
                        devices will be able to send and retrieve data from a
                        local cloud that is operating through the Pi. This setup
                        uses pre-existing BLE communication channel on the
                        devices and on the Pi to create a BLE communication. The
                        Pi then uses the pre-existing WiFi channel to
                        communicate with a local cloud through a local network.
                        The reliability of these connection will depend on the
                        manufacturing of the BLE devices, the Raspberry Pi, and
                        the school WLAN.

                        While this setup does propose a security risk for the
                        school, it is design to minimize the vulnerability as
                        much as possible with having just one direct connection
                        to the network rather than multiple. The risk that the
                        Pi does propose is similar to having an personal device
                        on the school network.
                        </br>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p> Our goal is to implement an intuitive, transparent
                        system that will allow two types of BLE devices, WeDo
                        and Sphero, to communicate with each other through a
                        cloud wireless network. These devices will be registered
                        with the Pi so that only they can access the local
                        cloud. The devices will then be able to send and
                        retrieve data from the local cloud independently. The
                        process of setting up the system, registering devices,
                        and setting up the local cloud is aimed to be as
                        user-friendly as positive (will be covered in the
                        Assumptions/Risks/Mitigations section of this project
                        plan) because we want teachers of all technological
                        background to be able to use the system. Therefore,
                        along with the Pi interface, we will also be developing
                        a website where there will be tutorials and GUI to the
                        Pi.
